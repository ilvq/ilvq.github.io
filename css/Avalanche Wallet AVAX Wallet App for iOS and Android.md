## What Is Avalanche (AVAX)?  

Avalanche is a high-performance blockchain platform designed to address the scalability and security challenges faced by earlier networks like Ethereum. Launched in September 2020 by Ava Labs, it combines the speed of Layer-2 solutions with the decentralization and security of Layer-1 blockchains. Its native token, **AVAX**, serves three core purposes:  

1. **Transaction Fees**: Paying for network usage.  
2. **Security**: Staking to secure the network through proof-of-stake (PoS).  
3. **Governance**: Voting on protocol upgrades and ecosystem decisions.  

Avalanche's compatibility with the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** allows developers to port Ethereum-based applications seamlessly, making it a popular choice for DeFi projects, NFT marketplaces, and enterprise solutions.
