## Key Metrics Explained  

Understanding these core concepts will enhance your trading precision:  

- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Measures profitability relative to your initial margin investment.  
  *Example*: A 50% ROE means you earned half your initial margin as profit.  
- **Profit and Loss (PNL)**: The net gain or loss from a trade, calculated using entry/exit prices and position size.  
- **Initial Margin**: The minimum collateral required to open a leveraged position.

## Case Study: Calculating ROE and PNL  

Letâ€™s walk through a practical example using Bitcoin (BTC):  

| Parameter         | Value          |  
|--------------------|----------------|  
| Position Type      | Long           |  
| Leverage           | 20x            |  
| Entry Price        | $30,000        |  
| Exit Price         | $33,000        |  
| Quantity           | 1 BTC          |  

**Results**:  
- **Initial Margin**: $1,500 (1 BTC / 20x leverage)  
- **PNL**: $3,000 (Profit from $3,000 price increase)  
- **ROE**: 200% ($3,000 profit / $1,500 margin)  

This example highlights how leverage magnifies both gains and risks. A 10% price move results in a 200% ROEâ€”but the same leverage could lead to liquidation if the market moves against you.
