# Particle (PARTI) Explained: What It Is, Future Prospects, and How to Buy  

## What Is Particle Network (PARTI)?  

Particle Network is a modular **Layer-1 blockchain** designed to solve the fragmentation challenges of multi-chain ecosystems through its **account abstraction** infrastructure. By enabling seamless interactions across 60+ EVM and non-EVM blockchainsâ€”including Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, and zkSync Eraâ€”it creates a unified environment for users and developers.

2. **Account Abstraction**: Enabled cross-chain identity management.  
3. **Chain Abstraction**: Expanded to Bitcoin via *BTC Connect*, creating interoperability across sovereign chains.  

This architecture addresses liquidity and user experience issues in fragmented ecosystems, offering universal accounts, liquidity, and gas solutions.  

### Key Use Cases  
- **Cross-chain DApp Development**: Simplifies deployment across multiple chains.  
- **User Onboarding**: Eliminates wallet complexity through social login options.  
- **NFT Ecosystems**: Provides toolkits for marketplace creation and management.
