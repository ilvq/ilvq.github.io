# Bybit Launchpool Introduces SUI to Expand Ecosystem Token Pools  

## Strategic Expansion of Ecosystem Token Pools  
Bybit Launchpool has taken a significant step forward by integrating **SUI**, a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, into its ecosystem token pool offerings. This expansion follows the platform's successful implementation of Mantle Network pools and underscores Bybit's commitment to fostering blockchain innovation. The introduction of SUI pools provides users with enhanced staking opportunities while supporting the growth of emerging ecosystems.  

A key strategic adjustment involves replacing the existing USDT pool with a **USDC pool** for SUI. This shift aligns with Circle's recent deployment of USDC on the SUI blockchain, offering users greater liquidity flexibility and ecosystem compatibility. By prioritizing stablecoin integration that matches project requirements, Bybit ensures its platform remains responsive to evolving market dynamics.

## SUI's Role in Bybit's Ecosystem Development  
As Bybit's first native ecosystem token pool beyond Mantle, SUI represents a pivotal milestone in the exchange's multi-chain strategy. SUI's innovative Move-based architecture and rapid adoption rate make it an ideal candidate for Launchpool's diversified offerings. This integration enables SUI holders to earn staking rewards through Bybit's infrastructure while participating in the network's security and governance.  

The timing of this launch coincides with critical developments in the SUI ecosystem, including:  
- Integration of Circle's USDC as native collateral

- Increased institutional interest in Move-compatible chains  

By offering dedicated token pools, Bybit positions itself as a critical infrastructure partner for next-generation blockchain projects.
